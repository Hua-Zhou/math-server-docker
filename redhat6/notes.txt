--- Notes for Shellinabox

You may have to open port for external access
# /sbin/iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 4200 -j ACCEPT
# /sbin/service iptables save

You can start the service with a non-root user using the following command:
# shellinaboxd --css=/misc/white-on-black.css

When using root user to start the service, it may not create the certificate automatically.
You can generate the certificate using the following commands:
# cd
# openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 7300 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout certificate.pem -out certificate.pem -subj /CN=local/
# mv certificate.pem .ssh
# chmod 400 .ssh/certificate.pem
